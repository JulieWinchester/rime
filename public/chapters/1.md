Icewind Dale lies under a blanket of cursed darkness, supposedly imposed by the cruel wintry goddess Auril the Frostmaiden. A wealthy and esteemed society mage, Vellyne Harpell, organizes an expedition to bring aid to the Ten Towns. And four wanderers, each one believing themselves to be wholly alone in the world, are hired by this enterprise. They are entirely unaware that this prosaic decision actually puts them on a path toward a shocking and momentous destiny…

Cam Sarris broods on a stagecoach, the small slice of his already-pale exposed face totally drained of color against the white frozen backdrop. The stagecoach is stuck in the snow in the criss-crossing mountain paths of the Ten Trail, high up in the Spine of the World. The blizzard encircling Icewind Dale was not supposed to extend this far south.

The stagecoach is rescued by a sled dog team run by the Reghed Uki Skeaŋka, Ace the white kobold, and Mairwen with the fire in her eyes. The group travels north up the mountain, trying to reach the Three Feathers Inn at the top of the Ten Trail, but they are interrupted by a mysterious sight. A traveler lies died, impaled by a beautiful but deadly dagger formed entirely from ice. More immediately, gnawing at the body and lying in wait under the snow are decaying fiends with the faces of hyenas and the bodies of people, jaws dripping with black slime and hungry for living flesh!
