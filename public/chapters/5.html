We met a naturalist by the name of Tully who, in a roundabout way, engaged us to investigate the lake monster (that I think is one of those water guys, from, you know, THE PAST - what&rsquo;s it doing here, now? So crazy). We have observed due caution in assessing the situation, talking with sailors, obtaining swimming bladders etc, intend to go out on the lake and see what&rsquo;s what in the morning. Current leading theory is that it&rsquo;s some sort of evil third presence doing some mischief and possibly controlling the monster??? We&rsquo;ll see!
