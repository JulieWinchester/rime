She seems to have really connected with the folk of Bremen, and her rapport with them was extremely helpful. Taking the local&rsquo;s advice, Mairwen and I went shopping for oiled leathers while Ace and Uki did some fishing and crafted supplies.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our night at the &ldquo;Buried Treasures&rdquo; Tavern and Inn was quiet - ace turned in on the early side and the rest of us drank by the fire without incident</span><span class="c14 c12">&nbsp;(</span><span class="c8">What a funny way of describing our conversation Cam!)</span><span class="c11">. THe next morning we set off with our acquaintance, Tully, a self-styled naturalist, to hunt down the creature sinking boats and terrorizing bremen sailors. We rented two boats from a local man, Grinsk. Uki and Mairwen took a sorry looking boat with a hole in the prow</span><span class="c12 c14">&nbsp;</span><span class="c10">Pronghorn pride!!!!!! {_}</span><span class="c5">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c5">Ace, Tully and I manned the other boat (named the &ldquo;burly Ram&rdquo;) as we set out toward the center of the lake, where the creature has historically appeared. While Uki/Mairwen made short and easy work of the sailing, the rest of us on the Burly Ram had a harder time, but we sorted it out in the end. After an hour or so of unsuccessful fishing attempts, &nbsp;Uki spotted a creature under the waves, and a strange eerie fog rolled in and surrounded our boats. We heard a voice issuing from the fog, offering insults about Grinsk and talking about granting wishes. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; SHowing some really prescient spell-work, Mairwen immediately dispersed the fog to reveal an enormous, long-necked creature with a face like an alligator in the water about 30 feet in front of us. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c5">What followed was a tense but amazingly successful conversation with the creature. It explained that it was created by a woman named &ldquo;Ravisine&rdquo;, who seems to have granted the creature self-awareness for the price of making the Sailors of Bremen suffer because it is &ldquo;auril&rsquo;s will&rdquo;. Turns out that Tully knows this Ravisine, and thinks she might be in Dugan&rsquo;s Hole. Mairwen and ace managed to convince the creature to stop attacking the people of Bremen, provided we find this Ravisine and prevent her from turning this creature back into a (relatively) mindless beast. &nbsp;it was pretty reasonable, as monsters go. It disappeared as suddenly as it came, having promised it will only eat fish from here on out.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c5">&nbsp;After that excitement, most of us returned to bremen to toast our relative success in defeating the monster (uki remained on the lake to do some fishing). In an effort to foster further goodwill in your name, We reported to the tavern/inn keeper regarding our success with the creature. Please find her attesting signature here:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, </span><span class="c9">Cora Malfue</span><span class="c11">, Proprietress of &ldquo;the Buried Treasures&rdquo; in bremen, hereby affix my seal and signature. That sums up our report on the incident in Bremen. </span></p></body></html>
