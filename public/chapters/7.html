Don&rsquo;t tell him I followed him please. We divided the loot from Tully amongst ourselves, she gave us some useful things that may come in handy (we will keep you apprised, I assume no cut should be sent back to HQ). We decide to continue investigating the ice dagger mystery by making our way to Good Mead. We stopped by Bryn Shander to stock up on weapons </span><span class="c5">(I got a sweet battleaxe!)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;and armor, where the proprietor at the Blackiron Blades told us about a yeti that cut off iron supply from the rest of the dwarves. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c19">Mairwen went shopping for the brightest, boldest flame clothing she could find and came across a WANTED poster for Ace, the white Kobold. Upon regrouping and learning that the Lord&rsquo;s Alliance has come all the way North in pursuit, I tracked down some blue dye to avoid further suspicion as we went from town to town. We rested in the expedition headquarters and definitely did NOT snoop around at ALL. But while we were NOT snooping, we noticed a decaying smell coming from upstairs and it was our duty to you and the expedition to investigate with a fae mouse familiar summoned by Mairwen. HOLY SEVEN HELLS WHY ARE THERE ZOMBIE KOBOLDS DOING YOUR FILING?! WHAT DID YOU DO TO THEM? WE WILL BE BRINGING THIS UP LATER. </span><span class="c5">(Seriously there are lots of underemployed clerks with families to feed who I&rsquo;m sure would work long shifts for you, this is super messed up.)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c3">Spooked by the zombies, we crossed the street to the House of Morninglord to find Tully and more information about the white dragon. We didn&rsquo;t find her, but we did hear about Copper and McCready&rsquo;s tinkering on the upper floor - Copper provided Ace with Tully&rsquo;s dragon research in return for a promise that the expedition would check in on McCready at his cabin North East of Lonelywood. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c3">We regrouped at an inn, given the expedition HQ didn&rsquo;t feel safe with the undead Kobolds filing away, where Uki revealed a troubled history with religion stemming from her childhood that resulted in her separation and isolation from her tribe. Mairwen had her own closely held beliefs that she shared in regards to her worship of Lathander. A courier found Uki and delivered a letter from Torrga, identifying our red-headed woman as Thyssa and locating her as heading northeast in the Dale. We decided as a team that it was our most urgent lead. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c10 c5">It was good to hear from Mairwen that not ALL gods are bad, but I&rsquo;m honestly more afraid of their worshippers. From what I&rsquo;ve seen, belief is like the wasting disease of the reindeer; it looks harmless at first, but slowly twists your friends and family into something cold and mindless and deadly. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5 c10">From the day I started teething (in a big way), everyone in the Tribe of the Tiger knew I could shift. It wasn&rsquo;t a big deal until I was 8 or so, when our shaman took an interest in me. I thought she was so wise and kind, teaching me about herbs and sneaking me extra fish and meat (I was always so hungry!). There were weird moments though... finding a half-carved bear totem buried in the snow, waking up from a nap to hear her mumbling spells over my head or whispering with the queen.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10 c5">As the years went on, more folks in the tribe starting treating me differently. They made me move into a special tent in the middle of our encampment, but it was full of incense and REEKED, so most nights I&rsquo;d sleep with the herd under the stars. I grew up a lot faster than the other kids, so it was hard to make friends, and the shaman wanted me to study all the time anyway. By the time I was 12, I was bigger and stronger than the 18-year-olds (and way better at tracking). </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10 c5">The queen called for a feast to celebrate my coming of age. I had to wear ceremonial furs and eat lots of food, then walk around the camp with everyone singing and praying and waving fir branches. Part of me loved the attention, but I didn&rsquo;t like the way people looked at me with wild joy, like I was a stranger to them. The shaman finally led me to my tent and had me wait for the queen, who was bringing a special gift. Instead, my dad burst through the back, grabbed my arm, and started sprinting toward the edge of camp. I could hear my mom shouting behind us, her axe whirling in the air. My dad shoved a pack into my hands and told me to run. I didn&rsquo;t get to say goodbye.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10 c5">That was over two years ago now. I&rsquo;ve heard rumors since then that my old queen actually worships Auril, which is why I&rsquo;m writing all this down. I don&rsquo;t know if we can actually stop Auril&rsquo;s curse, but maybe we can stop these sick believers from killing in her name.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3"></span><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Later that night in Bryn Shander, Cam Sarris sneaks out of his room at Geldenstag&rsquo;s Rest. He is quiet and careful. But he does not know the Ace has been waiting for this, half-awake in a burrow of blankets in their own inn room, and the white kobold is even more quiet and careful. Cam leaves the inn, and makes his way stealthily through city streets. Even from a distance Ace can tell he&rsquo;s on edge as he searches through alleys, behind buildings, and amidst piles of detritus. After several tense minutes in which Ace worries that Cam might discover their presence trailing him, Sarris darts down a narrow dead-end corridor between two double-story wooden buildings. Ace watches and waits. The alley is silent. And then there&rsquo;s Cam, at the head of the alley. He has a fox in his arms - the body of a fox? He&rsquo;s putting the fox in his pack. And there&rsquo;s blood on his face, which he wipes away with his hand, looking left and right out of the alley. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c11">Ace is finished with waiting, and they emerge from their hiding place to confront Cam. The kobold is shocked, and demands answers. Cam deflects, insists it is his business and his business alone. Ace keeps pressing, needing to know the truth of what they are seeing. The interaction devolves into a tense silence with hard stares on both sides. After a long pause, Cam says </span><span class="c11 c17">sotto voce</span><span class="c2">: &ldquo;Fine. If you must know, find me in my room at the Rest shortly. We&rsquo;re not having this conversation right here, right now.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c15"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c15"></span></p></body></html>
